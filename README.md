# Dealing with CeLTA Virtual Machines

The CeLTA and CLEAR VM, at least currently, 
have old versions of stuff (linux kernel, emacs , etc.)

Create a gitlab project called celta-vm-home-config

Put in stuff line .bash* .emacs.d/* (maybe .emacs for older emacs versions)

This way i can have a usable environment that i can keep up to date.
